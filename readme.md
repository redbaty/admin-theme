# Simple Admin Theme

This repo is heavily based on awesome [Gulp Starter](https://github.com/vigetlabs/gulp-starter) repository by [Viget Labs](https://github.com/vigetlabs)

I've planned to use it as my main admin template for my next personal projects and it should be distributed on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Bower](http://bower.io/) and [Packagist](https://packagist.org/), but wait until it ready.

**Demo is available here:** [http://feryardiant.me/admin-theme](http://feryardiant.me/admin-theme)
